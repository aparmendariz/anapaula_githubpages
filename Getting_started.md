# Getting Started

Welcome to the `mcf` Python package! This guide will walk you through the steps to get started with using this package in your Python projects.

## Data

### Case Study 1: Pennsylvania Reemployment Bonus Experiment

For our first case study, we use the Bonus data set from the Pennsylvania Reemployment Bonus experiment. This dataset provides an excellent opportunity to showcase the capabilities of mcf in real-world scenarios.

```python
# Your Python code here
def example_function():
    print("Hello, world!")

# Usage example
example_function()
```


### Case Study 2: Simulated Partially Linear Regression Model

As a second example, we simulate data from a partially linear regression model. This case study helps illustrate how DoubleML can be applied to analyze and model data generated from a known statistical framework.

Feel free to explore these case studies to understand the power and flexibility of mcf in handling various types of datasets and statistical models.

```python
# Your Python code here
def example_function():
    print("Hello, world!")

# Usage example
example_function()
