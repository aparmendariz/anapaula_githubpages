# Modified Causal Forests

Welcome to the documentation of `mcf`, the Python package implementing the Modified Causal Forest introduced by [Lechner (2019)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1812.09487). This package allows you to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects for binary and multiple treatments from experimental or observational data. Additionally, `mcf` offers the capability to learn optimal policy allocations based on decision trees.

If you're new to the `mcf` package, we recommend following these steps:

- **[Installation Guide](#installation-guide):** Learn how to install `mcf` on your system.
- **[Usage Example](#usage-example):** Explore a simple example to quickly understand how to apply `mcf` to your data.
- **[Getting Started]**: Dive into a more detailed example to get a better feel for working with `mcf`.

For those seeking more detailed information:

- The **[User Guide]** offers detailed explanations on specific topics.
- Check out the **[Python API]** for extra information on interacting with the `mcf` package.
- The **[Algorithm Reference]** provides a technical description of the methods used in the package.

## Installation Guide

The current version of `mcf` runs with Python **3.11**. You can install `mcf` from PyPI using

```bash
pip install mcf
```

For a smoother experience and to avoid conflicts with other packages, we strongly recommend using a virtual environment based on `conda`. Follow the steps below:

1. Install `conda` as described [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/).

2. Set up and activate a conda environment named *mcf-env*:

      ```bash
      conda create -n mcf-env
      conda activate mcf-env
      ```

3. Install Python **3.11**:

    ```bash
    conda install Python="3.11"
    ```

4. Finally install `mcf` in this environment using `pip`

    ```bash
    pip install mcf
    ```

Note: It is recommended to prioritize `conda install` for package installations before using `pip install`. On a Windows machine, if you plan to use Spyder as your IDE, make sure to execute `conda install spyder` before proceeding with `pip install mcf` to reduce the risk of errors during installation.

## Usage Example

To demonstrate how to use `mcf`, let's simulate some data and apply the Modified Causal Forest:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from mcf import ModifiedCausalForest

def simulate_data(n):
    """
    Simulate data with three treatment states captured by 'd', outcome 'y',
    unordered control variable 'female' and three ordered controls 'x1', 'x2',
    'x3'.

    Parameters:
    - n (int): Number of observations in the simulated data.

    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: Simulated data in a Pandas DataFrame.

    """
    d = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2], n, replace = True)
    female = np.random.choice([0, 1], n, replace = True)
    x_ordered = np.random.normal(size = (n, 3))
    y = (x_ordered[:, 0] +
        x_ordered[:, 1] * (d == 1) +
        x_ordered[:, 2] * (d == 2) +
        0.5 * female +
        np.random.normal(size = n))

    data = {"y": y, "d": d, "female": female}

    for i in range(x_ordered.shape[1]):
        data["x" + str(i + 1)] = x_ordered[:, i]

    return pd.DataFrame(data)

df = simulate_data(n = 500)

# Create an instance of class ModifiedCausalForest:
modified_causal_forest_model = ModifiedCausalForest(
    var_y_name = "y",
    var_d_name = "d",
    var_x_name_ord = ["x1", "x2", "x3"],
    var_x_name_unord = ["female"],
    _int_show_plots = False
    )

# Train the Modified Causal Forest on simulated data and predict treatment
# effects in-sample:
modified_causal_forest_model.train(df)
results = modified_causal_forest_model.predict(df)

# The 'results' dictionary contains the estimated treatment effects:
print(results.keys())

print(results["ate effect_list"]) # List of the treatment contrasts
print(results["ate"]) # Average Treatment Effects (ATE's)
print(results["ate_se"]) # Standard Errors (SE) for ATE's
```
